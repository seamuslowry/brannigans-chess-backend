# Brannigan's Chess

"In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces." -Zapp Brannigan

## Running the Project
- `docker-compose up`
- You should now see the service exposed on `localhost:8080`. Swagger for testing can be used on `localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`

## Goal
The project is still in active development, but the final goal is a chess app in which each player can only see their own pieces. Taken pieces will be visible to both players.
